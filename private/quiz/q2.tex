A 1400 kg car is driving at 20 m/s when the driver notices a stop sign 40 meters away. The driver hits the brakes, which apply a constant force of 8000 N. 
\begin{enumerate}

\item On the diagram below: draw arrows on the car indicating the direction of its instantaneous velocity and acceleration at some point after it started braking but before it has come to rest.\\

\end{center}
\item Is the car able to stop before reaching the stop sign?\\
\textit{Show your work, do not just answer ``yes'' or ``no''. You should calculate the exact distance the car travels before coming to rest.}
\end{enumerate}
