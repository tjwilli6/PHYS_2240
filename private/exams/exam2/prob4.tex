\question[20]  Your 1600 kg car has run out of gas and is coasting along at 20 m/s. You spot a gas station in the distance, but it is on the other side of a 15 meter high hill. Is your car able to make it to the gas station? Or will it get stuck on the hill? (We are ignoring friction and air resistance in this problem, so that your car can coast on flat terrain at constant speed forever).\\ \textit{Note: Show your work and justify your answer. You will not receive credit by simply answering ``yes'' or ``no'' without any justification}
