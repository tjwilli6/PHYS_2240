\question On the surface of the Earth, a block (mass $m=2$ kg) slides down the surface of a ramp which is inclined at an angle of $\theta=30^\circ$. The block is resisted by friction as it slides, so that it moves at a constant speed of 1.6 m/s.

	\part[5] Draw a free body diagram representing the forces acting on the block (be sure to label the object in the surrounding which is exerting the force)

	\part[15] What is the coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu$ between the block and the ramp?
