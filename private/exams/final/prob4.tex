\question[15]  Over a certain time interval, a ball is moving to the left or the right (or is motionless). The ball is subject to one or many unknown forces.
\begin{parts}
	\part If the ball is permanently at rest, which of the following are possible (check all that apply)?
	\checkboxchar{$\Box$}
	\begin{checkboxes}
		\choice There is a force acting to the right
		\choice The net force is zero
		\choice There is a net force acting to the right
		\choice There is a net force acting to the left
		\choice There is a force acting to the left
	\end{checkboxes}

	\part If the ball is moving to the right
	\begin{checkboxes}
		\choice There is a force acting to the right
		\choice The net force is zero
		\choice There is a net force acting to the right
		\choice There is a net force acting to the left
		\choice There is a force acting to the left
		\choice The momentum of the ball is changing
	\end{checkboxes}

	\part If the ball is moving to the left with increasing speed
	\begin{checkboxes}
		\choice There is a force acting to the right
		\choice The net force is zero
		\choice There is a net force acting to the right
		\choice There is a net force acting to the left
		\choice There is a net force acting to the left with increasing magnitude
		\choice There is a net force acting to the left with decreasing magnitude
		\choice There is a force acting to the left
		\choice The momentum of the ball is changing
	\end{checkboxes}

	\part If the ball is moving to the left at constant velocity
	\begin{checkboxes}
		\choice There is a force acting to the right
		\choice The net force is zero
		\choice There is a net force acting to the right
		\choice There is a net force acting to the left
		\choice There is a force acting to the left
		\choice The momentum of the ball is changing
	\end{checkboxes}
